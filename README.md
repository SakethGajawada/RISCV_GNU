# RISCV_GNU
## Testing
* Open a terminal window.
* Navigate to the directory containing the sample.c file.
* Design a function that executes the intended logic you require
* Compile the code using the GCC compiler and verify the output:
```
gcc sample.c
./a.out
```
## RISCV GNU Toolchain Installation

Refer [RISCV-GNU-Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain)


## Assembly Code Generation
Run the below command to generate an assembly instructions file for the function created in the sample.c.
```
riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump -d sample.c --disassemble=<function_name>Â  > filename.txt
```

## Assembly Instruction Counter
### Overview
The Assembly Instruction Counter is a Python script designed to analyze RISC-V assembly code files generated by the RISC-V GNU toolchain. It counts the number of different instructions used in the code and lists those instructions. This tool can be helpful in understanding the diversity of instructions within your assembly code.

### Usage
* Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

* Download: Place the line_follower.txt assembly code file in the same directory as the Python script (instruction_counter.py).

* Run the Script: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script and the assembly code file. Run the following command:

```
python instruction_counter.py
```
* Number of different instructions used.
The script will process the assembly code file and display the number of different instructions used along with a list of those instructions.
### Notes
* The script starts analyzing the assembly code from the sixth line of the file, excluding file format and section information.
* It ignores empty lines and lines beginning with '#' (comments).
* The script extracts the third part (instruction) from each line, assuming a consistent structure with at least three parts per line.
* The output provides the count and a list of unique instructions used in the assembly code.

Feel free to modify the script to suit your specific requirements or contribute to its development.

### Example
Suppose your assembly code contains instructions like addi, lw, sw, and so on. 
Running the script on this code would yield:
```
Number of different instructions: 3
List of unique instructions:
addi
lw
sw
```
